# What is it?
This notebook contains all the public notice for neub-cse.github.io/Noticeboard 

Links to notice image and PDFs are stored in a text file.

# How to prepare the text file?

* Just paste the true link of image or pdf file in the notice.txt file.
* Mutiple links should be separated in new lines.
* Comment any line with double question mark (??) at the start of the line. Avoid using comment after any link or name. Comments should be on a separate line.
* When you need to add name of notice use || to separate name and link. In such case name should come first and link should be next. 
* For only link please just paste the link in a line. No space should be provided after and/or before ||
